              <h1>What is Secure Programming?</h1>

              <p class="rb-text-grey">Secure programming is the principle of designing code that adheres to code security best
                  practices, safeguards and protects published code from known, unknown and unexpected vulnerabilities such as
                  security exploits, the loss of cloud secrets, embedded credentials, shared keys,confidential business data and
                  personally identifiable information (PII) (<i>What is secure coding?</i> 2022).
              </p>
                <p class="rb-text-grey">Secure programming includes protecting your applications from things like cross-site scripting,
                    SQL injection attacks, coding in user access management correctly and many more coding principles to protect user data
                    and in-house code.</p>

              <h1>What are Ethics?</h1>

              <p class="rb-text-grey">Ethics are defined as moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an
              activity. Their principles drive people to act in accordance with whatever ethical routes they believe to be of highest
              importance to the greater good. Most ethical formats center around the 4 same principles in different ways. Autonomy is
                  defined by the right to self-determination and respects the individual’s right to make informed decisions. Nonmaleficence
                  is often referred to as the “no harm principle” that is inherent in professional standards, licensure, and codes of ethics
                  and with an obligation not to place employees at risk of harm without protection. Beneficence relates to mitigating or preventing
                  harm and creating practices and environments that help others achieve their maximum health potential. Justice is directed toward
                  treating employees equally and without discrimination with regards to their health status, gender, ethnicity, social aspects, and the like.</p>
